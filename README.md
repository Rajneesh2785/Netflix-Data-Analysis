I conducted an in-depth analysis of Netflix data using SQL, addressing 15 business problems to uncover valuable insights. The analysis included categorizing content based on keywords in descriptions, identifying trends in global content production, and evaluating user preferences such as the most common ratings for movies and TV shows. I leveraged advanced SQL queries to classify content into 'Good' and 'Bad' categories, analyze yearly trends, identify top-performing countries and contributors, and explore time-based patterns like recent additions and decade-specific data. This project demonstrated my ability to extract meaningful insights, solve real-world problems, and provide actionable recommendations using SQL.
